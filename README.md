# 🎬 YouTube Data Engineering Pipeline

This project is a data engineering pipeline that analyzes trending YouTube videos using AWS services. I’m working on this to learn about ETL pipelines, cloud integration, and data visualization.

## 📌 About the Project

Inspired by the original project by [Darshil Parmar](https://github.com/darshilparmar/dataengineering-youtube-analysis-project), this is my version where I:
- Ingest structured/semi-structured data from a Kaggle dataset
- Store and manage data using **Amazon S3**
- Perform data transformation using **Python & Pandas**
- Visualize insights using **Amazon QuickSight**

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies

- **AWS S3**: Data storage
- **AWS IAM**: Permission management
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Data visualization/dashboard
- **Python**: Data wrangling & ETL
- **Pandas**: For handling tabular data
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data analysis
- **Git**: Version control

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comes from [Kaggle YouTube Trending Video Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new), which includes:
- Video title, views, likes, comments
- Tags, channel, publish time, description
- Category ID and trending dates
